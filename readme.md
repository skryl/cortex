# Cortex

  Cortex is a pure Ruby implementation of the Cortical Learning Algorithms
  outlined in the [CLA Whitepaper](https://www.groksolutions.com/htm-overview/education/HTM_CorticalLearningAlgorithms.pdf) from Numenta.


## GUI

The GUI uses a small window manager I wrote specifically for this project called [cursed](https://github.com/skryl/cursed).
